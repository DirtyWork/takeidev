                I'm a professional developer with a passion for new technologies. Currently I'm focused to Salesforce development, and more precisely to Lightning development with Aura and Lightning Web Components.
            </p>
            <p>In the recent times I have specialized more into building custom User Interfaces with Salesforce technology. That is one reason what inspired me to build this site.</p>
