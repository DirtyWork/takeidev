    <p>
        I'm a professional developer with a passion for new technologies.
        Currently I'm focused to Salesforce development, and more precisely to
        Lightning development with Aura and Lightning Web Components.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the recent times I have specialized more into building custom User
        Interfaces with Salesforce technology. That is one reason what inspired
        me to build this site.
